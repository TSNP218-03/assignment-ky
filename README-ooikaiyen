First of all, I created a Visual C# project using Console App(.NET Core).
Then, after creating the project, I added the all 130 total normal temperature readings 
into (from normtemp.dat.txt into a Quotes.txt). The text file I named it as Quotes.txt.

Each lines of data are determined as quotes for easier recognition.
from the "void Generate()" function, everytime user clicks the Generate button, a random
data out of 130 normal temperate readings will be shown on the program.

Besides, there is also a "exit" button for user to close the program.
